        <section> <!--front page description about the club-->
            <p>Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears, an English businessman who had earlier bought the Stamford Bridge
                athletics stadium with the plan of transforming it into a football ground. His original idea was to rent it
                to an existing club, but after a deal with Fulham FC was halted, he got the idea to start a new club.
                
                Chelsea boosted their Champions League qualification hopes with a convincing 3-1 victory over newly-crowned 
                champions Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. 
                Cole Palmer ended his 18-game goal drought by scoring a stoppage-time penalty against Liverpool, 
                capping off an impressive individual performance. 
                Chelsea currently sit in 5th place in the Premier League with 63 points, level with 4th-placed 
                Newcastle United as they push for a top-five finish and Champions League qualification. 

                Chelsea News:
                Neil Bath to step down and depart Chelsea: For the past three decades, 
                Neil has built a richly deserved reputation as one of the leading developers
                 of youth football and coaching talent across the world. His legacy extends well 
                 beyond the gates of Chelsea Football Club, with a vast alumni of players and coaches 
                 whose careers across the continent have flourished due to Neil’s influence.

                Neil has gone on to transform the Club’s youth set-up into the most successful academy 
                in English football, cultivating a winning mentality and culture of improvement and development.

                Neil said: ‘After 30 years working at Chelsea, I feel it is the right time for me to have some 
                time off and take a break from a job that I have put so much time into. I intend to rest and have 
                some time away from the game, however I will continue working over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition for the organisation.
