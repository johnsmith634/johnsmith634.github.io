    <h1>Title of paragraph</h1>
    <p>I am by birth a <b>Genevese</b>, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. 
        My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several 
        public situations with honour and reputation.</p>
    <h2>Title of paragraph</h2>
    <p>As the <i>circumstances</i> of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. 
        One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.</p>
    <h3>Title of paragraph</h3>
    <p><u>Beaufort</u> had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. 
        <u><b>Overjoyed</b></u> at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss.</p>
    <h4>Title of paragraph</h4>
    <p>But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his 
        fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some

    <h4>Title of paragraph</h4>
    <p>The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection,
         and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion</p>

        <p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural 
            philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subjec
            t of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius 
            Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined 
            me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my
             attention suddenly grew despicable.</p>
